# C Programming For Beginners - Master the C Language
## 01- Introduction
### 03 Fundamentals of a Program

- Computers are very dumb machines
- Computers instruction set
- Sending instruction to the instruction set
- Algorithm method
- Like even/odd number
- CPU Brain of Computer (Instructions are executed)
- RAM (Program while its running)
- Hardware drive (Permanent Storage)
- RAM Vs Hard Drive
- Operating System
    -  Control entire computer
    - All input / Output
    - Windows,Linux,Android..
- Fetch / Execute Cycle (Life of a CPU)
    - fetches an instruction from memory (using registers) and executes it (loop)
    - A gigahertz CPU can do this about a billion times a second
- Higher level programming languages
    - Easily wrote programs
    - C is higher level compare to assembly       
    - Easy problem solving
- Compilers
    - High Level to => Machine Instructions
    - Compiling Syntax


#### Steps in writing program

- Define the program objectives
- Design
- Write the code
- Compile
- Run the program
- Test and debug
- maintain and modify the program
